<center><h1><u>Theoretical Dimensions(7+)</u></h1></center>
Theoretical 7-dimensional concepts exist in multiple fields, such as in physics and mathematics, where it can refer to specific geometric spaces or a theoretical framework like M-theory. In health and wellbeing, it refers to a holistic model that includes Physical, Intellectual, Environmental, Vocational, Social, Emotional, and Spiritual health. Additionally, in cosmology, the idea of a 7-dimensional universe is explored within theories like String Theory and M-theory, which suggest extra dimensions beyond our familiar four. <br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>In physics and cosmology</h4><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Extra dimensions: Some theories, like String Theory, propose more than the four dimensions (three spatial and one temporal) we experience.</li>
<li>Seven-dimensional space: In mathematics, this is a space defined by seven coordinates, which has special properties, such as being one of the few dimensions where a cross product can be defined.</li>
<li>Cosmic evolution: Research has suggested that our universe's evolution may have favored three and seven dimensions, a concept explored in theories involving extra dimensions.</li>
<li>M-theory: This theory, which unifies different string theories, is a 7-dimensional theory that includes gravity and other fundamental forces.</li>
</ul>
<h4>In health and wellbeing</h4>
<ul>
<li>Holistic health: A model that considers health as a balance of multiple dimensions, which include:</li>
    <ol>
         <li>Physical health</li>
         <li>Intellectual health</li>
         <li>Environmental health</li>
         <li>Vocational health</li>
         <li>Social health</li>
    </ol>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Interconnectedness: This model views these dimensions as interconnected and influencing one another to create a sense of overall wellbeing. <br>
