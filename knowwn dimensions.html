<font size= 4 color="White"> Four-dimensional space (4D) is the mathematical extension of the concept of three-dimensional space (3D). Three-dimensional space is the simplest possible abstraction of the observation that one needs only three numbers, called dimensions, to describe the sizes or locations of objects in the everyday world. This concept of ordinary space is called Euclidean space because it corresponds to Euclid's geometry, which was originally abstracted from the spatial experiences of everyday life.
<br>
<br>
Single locations in Euclidean 4D space can be given as vectors or 4-tuples, i.e., as ordered lists of numbers such as (x, y, z, w). For example, the volume of a rectangular box is found by measuring and multiplying its length, width, and height (often labeled x, y, and z). It is only when such locations are linked together into more complicated shapes that the full richness and geometric complexity of 4D spaces emerge. A hint of that complexity can be seen in the accompanying 2D animation of one of the simplest possible regular 4D objects, the tesseract, which is analogous to the 3D cube.

<h3><u>History</u></h3>
<br>
<br>
The idea of making time the fourth dimension began with Jean le Rond d'Alembert "Dimensions" published 1754 in the Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers.[1][2] That mechanics can be viewed as occurring also in time was found by Joseph-Louis Lagrange c.1755 published 1788 in Mécanique analytique.
<br>
Mathematics of 4D commenced in the nineteenth century.[4] 3D form rotation onto its mirror-image is possible in 4D space was realized by August Ferdinand Möbius [5] in Der barycentrische Calcul published 1827.[6] An arithmetic of four spatial dimensions, called quaternions, was defined by William Rowan Hamilton in 1843. Soon after, tessarines and coquaternions were introduced as other four-dimensional algebras over R. Higher dimensional non-Euclidean spaces were put on a firm footing by Bernhard Riemann's 1854 thesis, Über die Hypothesen welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen, in which he considered a "point" to be any sequence of coordinates (x1, ..., xn).
<br>
Euclidean spaces of more than three dimensions were first described in 1852, when Ludwig Schläfli generalized Euclidean geometry to spaces of dimension n, using both synthetic and algebraic methods. He discovered all of the regular polytopes (higher-dimensional analogues of the Platonic solids) that exist in Euclidean spaces of any dimension, including six found in 4-dimensional space.[7] Schläfli's work was only published posthumously in 1901, and remained largely unknown until publication of H.S.M. Coxeter's Regular Polytopes in 1947. During that interval many others also discovered higher-dimensional Euclidean space. One of the first popular expositors of the fourth dimension was Charles Howard Hinton, starting in 1880 with his essay "What is the Fourth Dimension?", published in the Dublin University magazine, in which he explained the concept of a "four-dimensional cube" with a step-by-step generalization of the properties of lines, squares, and cubes. [a] [8] He coined the terms tesseract, ana and kata in his book A New Era of Thought and introduced a method for visualizing the fourth dimension using cubes in the book Fourth Dimension.[9][10] 1886, Victor Schlegel described[11] his method of visualizing four-dimensional objects with Schlegel diagrams.

<h3><u>Four-dimensional perception in humans</u></h3>
<br>
<br>
Research using virtual reality finds that humans, despite living in a three-dimensional world, can, without special practice, make spatial judgments about line segments embedded in four-dimensional space, based on their length (one-dimensional) and the angle (two-dimensional) between them.[17] The researchers noted that "the participants in our study had minimal practice in these tasks, and it remains an open question whether it is possible to obtain more sustainable, definitive, and richer 4D representations with increased perceptual experience in 4D virtual environments".[17] In another study,[18] the ability of humans to orient themselves in 2D, 3D, and 4D mazes has been tested. Each maze consisted of four path segments of random length and connected with orthogonal random bends, but without branches or loops (i.e. actually labyrinths). The graphical interface was based on John McIntosh's free 4D Maze game.[19] The participating persons had to navigate through the path and finally estimate the linear direction back to the starting point. The researchers found that some of the participants were able to mentally integrate their path after some practice in 4D (the lower-dimensional cases were for comparison and for the participants to learn the method).
<br>
However, a 2020 review underlined how these studies are composed of a small subject sample and mainly of college students. It also pointed out other issues that future research has to resolve: elimination of artifacts (these could be caused, for example, by strategies to resolve the required task that don't use 4D representation/4D reasoning and feedback given by researchers to speed up the adaptation process) and analysis on inter-subject variability (if 4D perception is possible, its acquisition could be limited to a subset of humans, to a specific critical period, or to people's attention or motivation). Furthermore, it is undetermined if there is a more appropriate way to project the 4-dimension (because there are no restrictions on how the 4-dimension can be projected). Researchers also hypothesized that human acquisition of 4D perception could result in the activation of brain visual areas and entorhinal cortex. If so they suggest that it could be used as a strong indicator of 4D space perception acquisition. Authors also suggested using a variety of different neural network architectures (with different a priori assumptions) to understand which ones are or are not able to learn.

<h3><u>Cross-sections</u></h3>
<br>
<br>
As a three-dimensional object passes through a two-dimensional plane, two-dimensional beings in this plane would only observe a cross-section of the three-dimensional object within this plane. For example, if a sphere passed through a sheet of paper, beings in the paper would see first a single point. A circle gradually grows larger, until it reaches the diameter of the sphere, and then gets smaller again, until it shrinks to a point and disappears. The 2D beings would not see a circle in the same way as three-dimensional beings do; rather, they only see a one-dimensional projection of the circle on their 1D "retina". Similarly, if a four-dimensional object passed through a three-dimensional (hyper) surface, one could observe a three-dimensional cross-section of the four-dimensional object. For example, a hypersphere would appear first as a point, then as a growing sphere (until it reaches the "hyperdiameter" of the hypersphere), with the sphere then shrinking to a single point and then disappearing.[22] This means of visualizing aspects of the fourth dimension was used in the novel Flatland and also in several works of Charles Howard Hinton.[9]: 11–14  And, in the same way, three-dimensional beings (such as humans with a 2D retina) can see all the sides and the insides of a 2D shape simultaneously, a 4D being could see all faces and the inside of a 3D shape at once with their 3D retina.
