<center><h1><u>Alternate Universe</u></h1></center><br>
<br>
An alternate or parallel universe is a hypothetical, separate universe that may coexist with our own, often existing in a multiverse. While this concept is a popular staple in science fiction, it is also a topic of serious discussion in theoretical physics, stemming from ideas in quantum mechanics, string theory, and cosmic inflation. <br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Scientific theories</h4><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Cosmic inflation: Some theories propose that regions of space are expanding at different rates. One model suggests that new "bubble universes" are constantly being created as part of this ongoing inflation</li>
<li>Quantum mechanics: The "many-worlds interpretation" suggests that every time a quantum event has multiple possible outcomes, the universe branches into separate universes, with each outcome occurring in its own reality.</li>
<li>String theory: This theory allows for the possibility of other universes existing alongside our own, potentially governed by different physical laws. </li>
</ul>
<h4>In fiction</h4>
<ul>
<li>Alternate universes are often used as a setting for stories where events unfold differently than in our reality.</li>
<li>These universes can be a minor variation, where a single event (like a historical war's outcome) is different, or they can be radically different, with unique physical laws or dominant species.</li>
<li>The concept is explored through alternate timelines, where events diverge from a specific point, or through entirely separate realities that are simply parallel to the "main" universe. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Key differences and concepts</h4><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Multiverse: The multiverse is the theoretical collection of all possible universes. It is the overarching concept that includes all alternate and parallel universes.</li>
<li>Different levels: Some theoretical frameworks propose different "levels" of parallel universes, ranging from other parts of our own infinite universe to universes with entirely different physical constants. </li>
</ul>
